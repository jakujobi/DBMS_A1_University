# Question
A video rental store used the following table to store the video rental information. Each video has a unique identifier and has one value for its Title, Star, Year Filmed, and Length
Each customer is uniquely identified (cuID) For each customer, their name (cuName) and address (cuAddress) are also recorded

Each time a customer rents a video, the Ship Date and Return Date are recorded

**VideoRental**

| Video<br>ID | Title          | Star     | Year<br>Filmed | Length | cuID | cuName | cuAddress      | Ship<br>Date | Return<br>Date |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------- | -------------- | ------ | ---- | ------ | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- |

# First Normal Form 1NF - Restricted Attributes
### Reasoning from UNF to 1NF
- To stop repeating the same video and customer details in every rental record. This reduces the amount of duplicate data.
- To ensure that every data item is stored as its smallest individual unit, making the database cleaner and more organized.
- To help find and organize data by a unique key.

Without adding any new attributes, here is the First Normal Form 1NF
- Each row has a unique identity, and each piece of information stands alone.

| Video<br>ID | Title          | Star     | Year<br>Filmed | Length | cuID | cuName | cuAddress      | Ship<br>Date | Return<br>Date |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------- | -------------- | ------ | ---- | ------ | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- |

## Keys
- **Primary Key**: 
	- Here, we use a combination of `VideoID`, `cuID`, and `ShipDate`.
- **Foreign Keys**:
    - `VideoID` references a `Videos` table, which is not shown here but would contain columns `VideoID`, `Title`, `Star`, `YearFilmed`, and `Length`.
    - `cuID` references a `Customers` table, which would contain `cuID`, `cuName`, and `cuAddress`.
- Code to make Video Rentals
```sql
CREATE TABLE VideoRentals (
    VideoID VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    Title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Star VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    YearFilmed INT NOT NULL,
    Length VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    cuID VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    cuName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    cuAddress VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    ShipDate DATE NOT NULL,
    ReturnDate DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (VideoID, cuID, ShipDate),
    FOREIGN KEY (VideoID) REFERENCES Videos(VideoID),
    FOREIGN KEY (cuID) REFERENCES Customers(cuID)
);
```

# Second Normal Form (2NF)
### Reasons from 1NF to 2NF
- To make sure each piece of information is fully dependent on a unique key.
  For example, video details (like title and year) should not need to be repeated for each rental if they can be identified by `VideoID` alone.
- To eliminate cases where part of the primary key determines some information but not all. This helps to further reduce unnecessary duplication.

We'll create three separate tables. To do so, we split up tables when a piece of information doesnâ€™t depend on the whole key.
Made one for `Videos`, one for `Customers`, and a new `Rentals` table to handle the relationships and transaction-specific details (like dates).
- This stops the same details from being entered multiple times across different rentals.
### Videos Table
Stores details about each video, including its unique identifier, title, star, year filmed, and length.
- It eliminates redundancy by centralizing all data related to the videos themselves.
- This makes sure that each video's details are stored only once.

| VideoID | Title          | Star     | Year Filmed | Length |
|---------|----------------|----------|-------------|--------|
| 001     | Deadpool       | Reynolds | 2016        | 1:48   |
| 002     | Empire Records | LaPaglia | 1995        | 1:30   |
SQL for Videos Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Videos (
    VideoID VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    Title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Star VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    YearFilmed INT NOT NULL,
    Length VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (VideoID)
);
```
---
### Customers Table
Holds information about each customer, such as their unique identifier, name, and address.
- By storing each customer's details in one place, the system avoids duplication.
- Our system also simplifies updates (like changing an address, name).

| cuID | cuName | cuAddress      |
|------|--------|----------------|
| c001 | John   | 110 Main Ave   |
| c002 | Bill   | 101 1st Ave    |
| c003 | Sally  | 302 5th St     |
| c004 | Mary   | 202 6th St     |
| c005 | Twila  | 333 Medary Ave |
SQL for Customers Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    cuID VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    cuName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    cuAddress VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (cuID)
);
```
---
### Rentals Table
Records each rental transaction, linking customers to the videos they rent, along with the shipping and return dates.
- It uniquely identifies each rental instance by combining `VideoID`, `cuID`, and `ShipDate`, which together form a composite primary key.
- This way, even if the same customer rents the same video multiple times, each transaction is uniquely recorded.

| VideoID | cuID | ShipDate | ReturnDate |
|---------|------|----------|------------|
| 001     | c001 | 4/11/18  | 4/18/18    |
| 001     | c003 | 5/5/18   | 5/12/18    |
| 001     | c002 | 1/1/19   | 1/8/19     |
| 002     | c002 | 1/1/19   | 1/8/19     |
| 002     | c004 | 4/1/19   | 4/8/19     |
| 002     | c005 | 7/4/18   | 7/11/18    |
SQL code for Rentals Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Rentals (
    VideoID VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    cuID VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    ShipDate DATE NOT NULL,
    ReturnDate DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (VideoID, cuID, ShipDate),
    FOREIGN KEY (VideoID) REFERENCES Videos(VideoID),
    FOREIGN KEY (cuID) REFERENCES Customers(cuID)
);

```

# Third Normal Form (3NF)
### Reasons from 2NF to 3NF
- To ensure that no piece of information depends on another piece of non-key information. For instance, a customer's name should not be defined or altered by their rental details or vice versa.
- To make the database more efficient and easier to maintain because each piece of information directly depends on the primary key, without being affected by other non-key attributes.

**Check:** 
1. It is in Second Normal Form (2NF).
2. It has no transitive dependencies (i.e., non-key attributes do not depend on other non-key attributes).
### 1. Videos Table
**No Changes Needed**: This table is already in 3NF as there are no transitive dependencies, and all non-key attributes depend solely on the primary key.
- `VideoID` is the primary key, and all other attributes (`Title`, `Star`, `YearFilmed`, `Length`) are dependent only on `VideoID` and not on each other.

|VideoID|Title|Star|Year Filmed|Length|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|001|Deadpool|Reynolds|2016|1:48|
|002|Empire Records|LaPaglia|1995|1:30|

---
### 2. Customers Table
**No Changes Needed**: All attributes are directly related to the primary key, and no attribute is dependent on another non-key attribute.
- `cuID` is the primary key, and both `cuName` and `cuAddress` depend only on `cuID`.

|cuID|cuName|cuAddress|
|---|---|---|
|c001|John|110 Main Ave|
|c002|Bill|101 1st Ave|
|c003|Sally|302 5th St|
|c004|Mary|202 6th St|
|c005|Twila|333 Medary Ave|

---
### 3. Rentals Table

**No Changes Needed**: In this table, `ReturnDate` depends only on the primary key components (specifically, it can be argued to be a function of `ShipDate` and the others as part of the transaction details). There is no dependency between non-key attributes.
- The composite primary key is (`VideoID`, `cuID`, `ShipDate`), and `ReturnDate` is dependent on the primary key.

|VideoID|cuID|ShipDate|ReturnDate|
|---|---|---|---|
|001|c001|4/11/18|4/18/18|
|001|c003|5/5/18|5/12/18|
|001|c002|1/1/19|1/8/19|
|002|c002|1/1/19|1/8/19|
|002|c004|4/1/19|4/8/19|
|002|c005|7/4/18|7/11/18|
